Jack Gentsch, Jacky Wang, Chinh Bui - EE 469 - Professor Peckol

This folder contains the first lab report for EE 469. 
The lab report is submitted in a PDF format, and contains the details of
the lab.

Important: each folder contains the top-level module and lower
level counter module for each counter design. The rippleup counter
and schematic-level counter contain a _GTK and _DE1 file, each is a
top-level module that is designed to either:
1. create a testbench that is usable within GTKwave or 
2. contains a clock divider to allow operation on the DE1-SoC and SignalTap.
The Schematic folder contains the .bsf file (schematic level block builder) file.

Thank you for grading our report, and feel free to send any additional
